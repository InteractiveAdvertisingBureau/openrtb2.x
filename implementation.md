The following section will provide brief notes on how certain objects and fields are to be interpreted and implemented.
	
## 7.1 - No-Bid Signaling <a name="nobidsignaling"></a>
	
This section covers best practices for using the optional no-bid signaling. See the [List: No-Bid Reason Codes](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb/blob/master/OpenRTB%20v3.0%20FINAL.md#list--no-bid-reason-codes-) in OpenRTB 3.0 for the enumerated list of no-bid reason codes.
	
Many exchanges support multiple response types as a no-bid:
	
- HTTP 204 “No Content” from the bidder (*most economical in terms of bandwidth*).
- An empty JSON object:<br>
 	```javascript
	{}
	```
- A well-formed no bid response:<br>
 	```javascript
	{"id": "1234567890", "seatbid": []}
	```
- A well-formed no bid response with a reason code:<br>
 	```javascript
	{"id": "1234567890", "seatbid": [], "nbr": 2}
	```
	
An important issue in RTB is when impressions are triggered by software robots mimicking web browsers. Such robots may be implicitly or explicitly driving these false transactions. The following represents a set of symmetric best practices for exchanges and bidders to help recognize and reject these events.
	
*Responsibility of the exchange*
	
Make best effort to classify and reject non-human traffic (NHT) requests for ads to the exchange via the following best practices:
	
- (Recommended) Filter impressions from known spiders via user-agent classification.
- (Recommended) Filter impressions from suspected NHT via a “detector”.
	
*Responsibility of the bidder*
	
- (Recommended) no-bid impressions from known spiders via user-agent classification.
- (Recommended) no-bid impressions from suspected NHT via a “detector”.
- Specify a no-bid reason code in either case.
	
*Where:*
	
- For exchanges, filtering the impression means that the exchange should respond to the “ad call” with either a blank HTTP 204 response or an unpaid ad (PSA) and not offered to any bidders.
- For bidders, filtering the impression means that the bidder should respond with a no-bid.
- For both exchanges and bidders, the impression transaction records should be clearly marked in any logging systems and be removed from contributing to any event counts associated with planning, forecasting, and reporting systems.
	
## 7.2 - Impression Expiration <a name="impressionexpiration"></a>
	
Recapping the typical impression flow through RTB, an ad will be requested by a client (e.g., web browser, mobile app or an SDK therein) possibly through other server intermediaries, and ultimately to the RTB exchange. The exchange conducts an auction among buyers who bid with a proposed price, possibly markup for use if the bid wins (markup can also be delivered on the win notice itself), and other metadata about the bid. The exchange then selects a winner, issues a win notice to the winning bidder, and passes the markup back to the client.
	
Winning the auction, however, does not guarantee that the ad will be successfully delivered to the client or that it will meet viewability expectations. Furthermore, policies vary among exchanges as to the criteria for billing. Most consider an ad billable upon some form of delivery or rendering vs. the auction win alone. This aligns better with the buyer’s obvious goal of ensuring that the impressions they pay for are actually displayed.
	
Some exchanges attempt to facilitate this alignment by placing the win notice in the winning ad markup so that it can serve as both a win notice and rendering notice. This is neither endorsed nor prohibited by OpenRTB except that it precludes the exchange from accepting markup on the win notice return as described in [Section 4.2.1](2.6.md#objectbidresponse). Similarly, many buyers use their own tracking URL placed within their ad markup to signal rendering independent of the OpenRTB auction win notice. In video specifically, VAST supports an impression tracking URL that is often used for billing and is always distinct from the auction win notice.
	
To abstract the concept, let us refer to “*billing notice*” as the firing of some notification URL at the time when the clearing price of the impression will be booked as spend. This is irrespective of whether the actual OpenRTB win notice URL is delegated to the client for firing or some other tracking URL is used.
	
For buyers, this billing notice is used to book progress toward spend goals and frequency caps and drive pacing algorithms. When the billing notice is delayed significantly, these critical functions can be seriously impaired. There are legitimate reasons for some delays such as caching. A common scenario is a video interstitial impression in a mobile app. Refining the example, consider a game where the video is prefetched during game play so that it can be shown after the current game level ends. This is important for the user experience but can delay the rendering of the ad for many minutes.
	
Bidders are strongly advised to track the time between the auction and the win and/or billing notices to ensure reasonable delays. If unreasonable delays are encountered frequently, bidders may elect to ignore such events and bring them to the attention of the exchange for resolution. Unfortunately, the sequence from ad request through the auction and finally to rendering and billing is fundamentally not transactional. There are simply too many parties, policies, and technologies involved and thus a good support relationship between exchange and buyer is still important.
	
The OpenRTB protocol does provide some real-time assistance, however. The `imp.exp` attribute ([Section 3.2.4](2.6.md#objectimp)) in the bid request allows an exchange to provide guidance to bidders of the number of seconds that may elapse between the auction and the billing event. As usual, omitted means unknown. Bidders can then decide if they want to bid understanding the likely delay. Bidders are advised, however, to interpret this as guidance as opposed to a contract unless the exchange expresses otherwise since exchanges are not always in a position to make hard guarantees (e.g., the SDK within the client app may not be under the exchange’s control).
	
Similarly, the `bid.exp` attribute ([Section 4.2.3](2.6.md#objectbid)) in the bid response allows the bidder to express the maximum number of seconds they are willing to tolerate between auction and billing notice. This allow the exchange to drop bids with expiration constraints it believes are likely to be violated. Bidders should not assume that a delayed billing notice greater than their specified bid expirations will not be billable. That is a policy and contract discussion between bidder and exchange and not imposed by OpenRTB.
	
The following expiration times are offered as examples of reasonable delays based on the nature of the impression. These are only provided as rules of thumb. A more data-driven method of determining these times in specific situations is highly recommended.
<table>
  <tr>
	  <td>Desktop and mobile web browsers</td><td>1 Minute</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Mobile app banner ads that may be cached</td><td>5 Minutes</td></tr>
	<tr> 
		<td>Mobile app native ads that may be cached</td><td>10 Minutes</td></tr>
	<tr>  
		<td>Mobile and video interstitials</td><td>30 Minutes (or even longer)</td></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Audio or video with server-side stitching</td><td>Very Long or Unknown</td></tr>
	</table>
	
## 7.3 - PMP & Direct Deals <a name="pmpanddirectdeals"></a>
	
**Best Practice Bidding Logic**
	
Receive request and parse;<br>
Create empty bid list for response;<br>
If request contains the `impression[].pmp` object; match bids against each `pmp.deals[]`;<br>
enforce targeting for dealID and seatID; append best M matching bids to response;<br>
If `pmp.private_auction` = False;<br>
match open auction bids against the request; append top N bids by price to response;<br>
Return response list to exchange;<br>
	
*Recommendations*
- M >= 1, preferably one per matching Deal ID.
- N >= 2 to assist with blocking rate issues.
- Minimum viable is “1+1” bidding.
- Ideal is “M+N” bidding.
	
**Warning**
	
Returning only one bid when both Deal ID and open auction bids are valid creates problems. The exchange side may be configured by a publisher to prioritize all Deal ID bids above open auction bids, or to force a price auction between them with different floors by class of bid. There are multiple common practices that depend on how the publisher prefers to sell inventory with Deal ID.
	
**Policy Recommendations**
	
- A Deal ID should be utilized for any situation where the auction may be awarded to a bid not on the basis of price alone. Any prioritization of bids other than by price should have a Deal ID.
- A Deal ID is recommended for all situations where a preferential floor may be assigned to a seat entity.
	
**Anti-Patterns**
	
The below is a set of anti-patterns that OpenRTB supporting platforms have observed in various attempts to implement Deal ID bidding logic.
	
**Subjecting Deal ID Bids to an internal auction on price**
	
The ideal bidding logic describes a process of being liberal about sending bids. Deal ID bids may not be subject to a classic price auction. There may be an expectation that the buyer and seller want prioritization to achieve a larger objective: complete delivery of the Deal represented by the Deal ID. Thus any bidding logic that sorts Deal ID bids by price (with or without open marketplace bids) and truncates the list too aggressively can endanger the fulfillment of the Deal.
	
**Associating Deal ID to the wrong Object**
	
A Deal ID should be treated as a “targeting token” associated to orders, line-items or campaigns. If the Deal ID is associated to a Seat/Buyer it may create an undesired application of the Deal ID too many active campaigns. Alternatively if it is associated to the Advertiser it may limit that entity to only a single Deal ID.
	
**Improper Handling of the Private vs Open Market Flag**
	
The `pmp.private_auction` flag indicates that the seller is willing or not willing to accept open market bids (i.e., “all bidders are welcome”). If this flag is not read and interpreted correctly, bid responses may be invalid. Open market bids sent to a private impression auction may be rejected and should not have been exposed to all bidders.
	
**Improper handling of Seat IDs**
	
If Seat IDs are treated as a filter of eligible demand partners on an open market impression, this defeats the “all bidders are welcome” intention.
	
**Silently Applying Margin Discounts to Deal ID Bids**
	
With Deal ID buyers are sellers are communicating directly. The Exchange and Bidder become third- party automation platforms. If there are any automatic or silent discounts of bid prices (based upon margins or fees) set by either the exchange or the bidder, then the Deal may fail to function correctly.

## 7.4 - Skippability <a name="skippability"></a>
	
This section clarifies the common use cases related to declaring skippability of video creatives.
	
Under most circumstances for RTB transactions, publishers and exchanges prefer to control the ability to skip the ad. OpenRTB therefore assumes by default that a standard linear video ad can be used as the
response to a skippable request and the ability to skip the ad will be provided by the supplier’s player automatically.
	
The presence of the `video.skip` attribute in the bid request with a value of “1” should be assumed to mean that the publisher will impose a skip button on the ad. The absence of the `video.skip` attribute should be assumed to mean that it is unknown whether the publisher will impose a skip button.
	
DSPs should confirm with publishers whether it is permissible to respond with ads that provide their own skip functionality (e.g., using VPAID to render a skip button). If bidding with such an ad and only if doing so, the bid must indicate creative attribute “16” using the `attr` array in the bid response.

*<b>NOTE</b>: VAST 4.0 separates VPAID interactivity from the media file so this is deprecated and only applies to earlier versions of VAST*
	
Some examples of these concepts follow:
	
**Bid Request**
	
*Case-1: Skippable after N Seconds for All Creatives*
	
In this case, the publisher will impose skippability. All ads will be skippable, but only after 5 seconds of play. Creatives with a total duration of 5 seconds or less would not be skippable since they would never reach this threshold.
	
```javascript
"video": {
	
..., 
 "skip": 1, 
 "skipafter": 5, 
 ...
	
}
```
	
*Case-2: Skippable after N Seconds for Minimum Duration Creatives*
	
In this case, the publisher will impose skippability. However, only creatives with a total duration greater than 15 seconds will be skippable. For ads that satisfy this minimum total duration, skippability is enabled after 5 seconds of play. Note that although these values are integers, they will compare as precise values with actual video durations. For example, a video with duration 15.1 seconds does satisfy a `skipmin` value of 15 (i.e., think of the `skipmin` value as being 15.0).
	
```javascript
"video": {
	
...,
"skip": 1, 
"skipmin": 15, 
"skipafter": 5, 
...
	}
```
	
*Case-3: Non-Skippable unless Requested by the Ad Markup*
	
In this case, the publisher will not impose skippability. Ads will only be skippable if requested by the ad markup. This is supported by VPAID and VAST 3.0, for example.
	
```javascript
"video": {
	
...,
"skip": 0, 
...
	
}
```
	
*Case-4: Unknown Skippability*
	
In this case, the `skip` attribute is omitted which indicates that exchange does not know if skippability will be imposed by the publisher. This may be the case, for example, when the exchange is not an SSP and thus may not have control or full knowledge of the publisher’s intentions.
	
**Bid Response**
	
Consider Case-3 above, where the publisher does not impose skippability. If the ad markup itself will request skippability (e.g., via VPAID or VAST 3.0), then the bid must signal this intention. This is accomplished by including creative attribute 16 (i.e., Skippable) in the bid as shown below. If the markup is not going to request skippability, then this creative attribute should not be indicated.
	
When responding to Case-3 with this skippable attribute specified in the bid, the publisher should provide skippability either by instructing the VAST 3.0 player to activate skippability (refer to the VAST
3.0 `skipoffset` attribute) or by allowing the ad to render its own skip button using VPAID.
	
```javascript
"bid": {
	
..., 
"attr": [16], 
...
	
}
```
	
In Case-1 and Case-2 where the publisher may impose its own skippability, creative attribute 16 should not be specified. Furthermore, publishers are advised to filter responses containing attribute 16 since this could conflict with the skip button rendered by the publisher. When using a VAST 3.0 response, publishers may choose to implement support for VAST 3.0 `skipoffset` at their discretion and ads should be assumed to play non-skippable if the player does not support it.

## 7.6 - Pod Bidding for Video and Audio <a name="podbidding"></a>
	
Starting in version 2.6, OpenRTB now supports ‘pod bidding’ for video and audio content streams.
An ad pod is the term describing an ad break of the type you’d see in a TV-like viewing experience or hear on a radio stream. An ad pod typically contains one or more in-stream creative assets that play out contiguously within a stream of video or audio content. Ad podding features in OpenRTB 2.6 build on capabilities in previous versions for including multiple ad requests within a single bid request object to indicate those ad requests are in some way related. Pod bidding signals communicate additional information about the pod & impression opportunities within the pod such as the sequence of the ad impressions, total pod length, maximum # of ads within a pod, multiple pod associations, and more.
	
**Terminology**
	
Ad Slot: Space for an individual ad impression within a pod.
	
Structured Pod: The seller offers a fully defined pod structure; the number of ad slots, their slot in the ad pod, and duration is pre-defined and static.

![](assets/structured_pod.png)
	
Dynamic Pod: The seller offers a pod structure where the number of ads & the duration of each ad in the break is indeterminate, but the total duration and maximum number of ads are constrained. In other words, the total duration of the pod is known, but the number and durations of the individual ads within the break may not be defined ahead of time. This allows bidders more flexibility to optimize their selection of ads across the demand on their platform.
	
![](assets/dynamic_pod.png)
	
Hybrid Pod: The seller offers a pod structure containing BOTH structured and dynamic components. In other words, the ad pod is composed of some combination of ad slots with predetermined durations, and ad slots constrained by a total duration & maximum number of ads.

![](assets/hybrid_pod.png)

**Recommendations**
	
- Sellers should only indicate a `slotinpod` of 1, 2, or -1 if they can absolutely guarantee placement of an ad within the first or last slot of an ad pod.
- Buyers should only indicate a `slotinpod` in response to a dynamic pod segment, including a dynamic component of a hybrid pod, if they only want to buy the first or last ad slot specifically
- Note that buyers should *only* return a `slotinpod` value in response to a Dynamic portion of a pod.
- Buyers should avoid using the `slotinpod` attribute in bid responses for structured pods, or the structured components of hybrid pods, because the `impid` field already uniquely identifies the ad slot.
- Buyers should look for `mincpmpersec` when available, otherwise fall back to `bidfloor`
- Sellers should include either the required durations (`rqddurs`) attribute, communicating exact durations, OR the `maxduration` & `minduration` attributes, but not both.
- Sellers are encouraged to include the `maxseq` attribute when offering a dynamic pod with a pod duration
- Sellers are encouraged to offer dynamic pods when possible to allow bidders to source the most optimal demand from their platforms
- Buyers should expect that final pod construction is done by the seller. Buyers who submit N bids for a particular pod may find that the seller selects anywhere between 0 to N of those bids to construct the pod that is shown to the user. Furthermore, the seller may co-mingle bids from other buyers in that pod.

**Pod bidding example scenarios**
	
*“Structured” Ad Pod Request/Response*
	
This scenario illustrates an example where the bid request contains 2 structured ad pods, and the response corresponds to the first positions in each of the 2 signaled pods.

*“Dynamic” Ad Pod Request/Response*
	
This scenario illustrates an example where the bid request contains 1 dynamic pod, the publisher can guarantee delivery against the first or last slot, and the response contains 3 bids from 3 different advertisers, for the signalled pod. The first bid in the response is only eligible for the first position in the pod.

*“Hybrid” Ad Pod Request/Response*
	
This scenario illustrates an example where the bid request contains slot 1 in the first impression object and a dynamic pod to fill the duration. The response contains 3 bids from 3 different advertisers, for the signalled pod. The first bid in the response is only eligible for the first position in the pod and the second two responses would be to fill the remainder of the pod.

## 7.7 - Network vs Channel Example Cases <a name="networkandchannel"></a>
	
Starting in version 2.6, OpenRTB now supports Network and Channel objects. See [3.2.23](2.6.md#objectnetwork) and [3.2.24](2.6.md#objectchannel) for details).While these examples are straight forward for traditional linear television, the options for CTV consumption warrant a few examples.
	
*Example 1*: A user viewing content on an internet connected device, on an app with multiple channel options (e.g. Discovery+ App > HGTV Channel/show)
	
- Discovery is the Network
- HGTV is the Channel
	
*Example 2*: A user viewing content on an internet connected device, on an app that streams content directly (Roku > Hulu > Hulu Original show)
	
- Hulu is the network (also identified by `bundle`)
- Hulu is the channel
	
 *Example 3*: A user viewing content on an internet connected device, on a device offered channel (Roku > Fubo > Comedy Central show)
	
- Roku is the device
- FuboTV is the network (also identified by `bundle`)
- Comedy Central is the channel
	
*Example 4*: A user is viewing content on an internet connected device, on a device offered channel that licenses content (Samsung TV > Pluto > Pluto TV Spotlight)
	
- Samsung TV is the device
- Pluto is the network (also identified by `bundle`)
- PlutoTV Spotlight is the channel
	
## 7.8 - Counting Billable Events and Tracked Ads <a name="counting"></a>
	
There are multiple conventions for how to count billable events or tracked ads via OpenRTB, typically an impression or other such common metric. This section outlines the common ones, addresses common mistakes, and offers a comparison of the approaches.
	
This section addresses technical methods available for implementers to consume these events. These events have specific business definitions and criteria for counting eligibility set by the Media Rating Council, and implementers should also consult the[ Media Rating Council’s guidelines](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/Standards.htm).
	
Implementers should discuss the definition of the billable event and the technical basis for counting it with their counterparties to determine a mutually acceptable approach.
	
**Overview of counting methodologies**
	
	
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Method</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Remarks</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pixel in Markup</td>
    <td>- Widely supported<br>

	- Usually (and recommended to be) fired server-to-server, but based on an initial client-side event</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Native eventtrackers/imptrackers/jstrackers</td>
    <td>- Only applicable to native ads</td>
  </tr>
</table>
	
	
**Pixel in markup (banner ads)**
	
This is the original convention for counting impressions/tracked ads; in this method, the OpenRTB specification itself does not address how to receive the events. The bidder self-embeds a tracking pixel in their HTML markup (i.e. an <img> tag which makes a request to the bidder’s servers). When the client device loads the markup, it fires the pixel.
	
For banner ads on web, this is a widely adopted approach to counting billable events/tracked ads, however some circumstances arise in which there may be discrepancies. Differences in timing between when an exchange’s and a DSP’s pixel load may result in discrepancies, and the noisy nature of the public Internet and variable connectivity quality of client devices may result in one pixel firing but not the other. Additionally, this method does not address certain scenarios well, namely:
	
- **Mobile apps** – a billable event may only be counted when the ad is displayed. In mobile apps, the markup is often fetched well in advance of being displayed to buffer against slow and unreliable connections. The markup may never be displayed if the user abandons the app before the ad is displayed – especially for interstitials.
	
- **Creative auditing** – markup may be loaded to scan for malvertising, etc., which may generate spurious extra billable/tracked ad events, including for unwon auctions.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: When it is possible to do so, exchanges should avoid using adm-based notifications as the determinant for billing events in the mobile app context, and instead use burl or an independent measurement approach (e.g. OMID), that is predicated upon an ad actually being displayed to the user.
	
**VAST <Impression> event (video/audio)**
	
The VAST specification includes a provision for <Impression> objects, which demand chain participants can use to request notifications when a billable event has occurred. The IAB prescribes that for video, the VAST <Impression> event is the official signal that the billable event has occurred.
	
Demand chain participants are discouraged from using billing notice URLs (burl) for video/audio transactions.
	
**Billing notice (“burl”)**
	
Billing notice support was introduced in OpenRTB 2.5. In this scenario, **outside** of the ad markup itself, a “billing notice URL” is included in the bid response. A billing event is when a transaction results in a monetary charge from the publisher to an exchange, and subsequently from the exchange or other intermediary to one of their demand-side partners. This event is subject to publisher and exchange-specific business policies that should be conveyed clearly to their partners. For a DSP, this event signals that they can increment spend and deduct the remaining budget against the related campaign. The exchange conveys this event by invoking the URL provided by the demand source in the bid.burl attribute.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: Firing the billing notice URL represents the fulfillment of a business transaction between a publisher and an exchange, or between the exchange and its demand partner. This should not be delegated to another party including a client-side pixel, although a pixel may be the initiating signal for billing to the exchange.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: Exchanges, upon determining that a billable event has occurred (e.g., receipt of client-initiated billable event), and in order to minimize discrepancies between themselves and their demand sources, should invoke the billing notice from the server-side. This should be done as "close" as possible to the moment when the exchange books revenue. See the below section regarding best practices for server-side billing notifications.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: Exchanges are highly encouraged to standardize on a client-initiated render or viewability event as the basis for the billing event. This is generally the most consistent approach in a complex supply chain scenario composed of multiple auction decision points.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: Publishers should generally refer to the [Media Rating Council’s guidelines](http://mediaratingcouncil.org/Standards.htm) to determine when the criteria have been met to consider a transaction billable.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: The public internet is noisy and this event is financial in nature. If an entity calling a billing notice receives a response other than HTTP 200 or 204, it should consider a retry scheme (e.g., every 10 seconds for the next minute). Conversely, an entity receiving billing notices should endeavor to make their endpoint idempotent to avoid double counting.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: When it is possible to do so, exchanges should avoid using adm-based notifications as the determinant for billing events in the mobile app context, and instead use burl or an independent measurement approach (e.g. OMID), that is predicated upon an ad actually being displayed to the user.
	
For VAST video/audio, if the `bid.burl` attribute is specified, it should be fired at the same time as the VAST <Impression> event. However, subtle technical issues may lead to additional discrepancies and bidders are cautioned to avoid this scenario. One option is for exchanges nearest a video supply source to use the VAST <Impression> event as their billing signal and then use the billing notice URL (burl) as described.
	
**Native eventtrackers, imptrackers, jstrackers**
	
For native ads specifically, the OpenRTB Native specification offers options for including an impression tracking URL or script to be loaded at impression time. See the [OpenRTB Native](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb-native/) spec for more information. For native video, most platforms utilize the impression events within VAST for billing and other event notifications, rather than the structured tracking options available within the native spec.
	
**Win notice (“nurl”) – not a billable or tracked ad event**
	
At first glance, an auction “win” and the associated win notice (`nurl`) field appears suitable as a proxy for billable/tracked ad counting. However, winning an auction does not guarantee that an impression will indeed be served, and in fact in many cases only a small percentage of won auctions will become impressions. This occurs because of downstream auctions (i.e. client-side header bidding), inability to play back media (in video and audio), etc.
	
**Win notice URLs should never be used to count impressions or tracked ads.**
	
### Best Practices for server-side billing notifications
	
In some cases, publishers or their vendors may choose to fire impression notifications from a server. This is very common in long-form video, which uses server-side ad insertion to coordinate the delivery and measurement of ads to a “thin” client on the user’s device. It is also common in mobile app, where the monetization SDK uses a server-side service to fire burl notifications.
	
The following best practice is derived from the [VAST 4.2 spec](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/VAST_4.2_final_june26.pdf) (page 17), but recommended for any impression notification (for all formats, regardless of protocol or version).
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: When possible, exchanges are encouraged to send billing notice URL (burl) notifications from the server-side, to minimize discrepancies with demand partners. The billable event itself should originate from a client-side event per MRC guidelines.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: When firing impression notifications via HTTP request from the server-side, the notifier should:
	
- Make use of the X-Forwarded-For or X-Device-IP HTTP header to indicate the IP address of the client device on behalf of which the notification is being sent.
- Make use of the X-Device-User-Agent HTTP header to indicate the UserAgent of the client device on behalf of which the notification is being sent.
	
These HTTP headers allow recipients of impression notifications to run anti-IVT checks using metadata about the end user device, rather than the server itself.
	
**BEST PRACTICE**: When firing impression notifications via HTTP request from the server-side, the notifier should establish an [ads.cert Call Sign](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2-ads-cert-call-signs-pc.pdf) and make use of the [ads.cert Authenticated Connections protocol](https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3-ads-cert-authenticated-connections-pc.pdf) to cryptographically sign notifications. This allows recipients of impression notifications, who’ve established ads.cert Call Signs of their own, to authenticate the sender for anti-fraud purposes.
	

## 7.9 - Digital Out-Of-Home <a name="dooh"></a>

This section details the unique differences between trading the online world of digital display and real-world aspects of Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) media. Each sub section references the key objects that enable DOOH to be traded using the OpenRTB standard.
	
### 7.9.1 -  Multiple/Variable Impressions
The OpenRTB trading method was built around the assumption that a targeted user holds one device and is served an ad as they visit a webpage e.g. One impression = One user.
OOH Media is a medium where one advert play (a spot) is viewable by everyone who is in the vicinity of the advert being displayed e.g. One ad display = multiple viewers/users (this number can be both greater than *or* less than 1 - due to numbers being based on statistical modeling, fractional values (e.g. .32 impressions per ad display) are common. These rates are also variable as they may be based on hourly-adjusted projections, or real-time sensor data.

Multiplying by decimal values (especially with a CPM) can lead to discrepancies when the ‘buy side’ and ‘sell side’ truncate decimal places. Measures need to be taken to avoid this at an account level.
	
The OpenRTB imp object now includes a qty object that enables the multiplier dimension

### 7.9.2 Unique Device Characterisitcs
	
#### 7.9.2.1 Highly Variable Physical Size
The majority of devices that are served ads via OpenRTB are of a size that one person can hold or lean into. In OOH media the advert can be traded and served on anything from the size of a shelf edge label to the size of multiple football pitches. This far exceeds the size range of anything that can be held in the viewer's hand or hung on their living room wall.

The size and direction of an OOH display not only affects the size of the audience that could see it, but also changes the chances of the audience that will see the advertisement being served.

A common trait with both OOH and  digital display ads is that there are a wide variety of sizes, resolutions and aspect ratios to be accommodated as the physical displays ‘build into’ physical spaces vary, and may contain additional content (e.g. tickers, application, labels) that cause ad slot sizes to vary.
	

#### 7.9.2.2 Private Networks / Geo-Location Information
The majority of commercial DOOH digital displays sit on ‘walled garden’ private ip networks. This protects the displays from a wide spectrum of internet security issues, vulnerabilities and attacks.

This can lead to 3rd party ad serving, cookies and http event logging service being constricted by the ‘safe-lists’ of urls allowed through the ‘walled garden’ security. 

Many Media Owners / Publishers therefore publish proprietary ‘1st Party’ playout reports and confirmations and use ‘1st Party’ ad servers and/or CMS systems.

The use of private ip networks also means that DSPs are not able to use their normal IP address geolocation techniques to get information about where ads are delivered - though publisher-reported locations (e.g. lat/lon, geo information like address, zip, region) are almost always available. In the case of moving media (e.g. taxi-top displays, bus panels, etc.) near-real time GPS-derived information is common.

#### 7.9.2.3 Non-Persistent Connections / Longer-Than-Realtime Delays
Most DOOH display panels in urban and remote connections rely on cellular networks for their network connectivity. Whilst a Media Owner may have their own private network with a telecoms provider, the network is still at the mercy of congestion on the local cell tower. Over subscription to cell towers at peak times and locations leads to the DOOH display panels having non-persistent internet connection. 

To mitigate this, some DOOH Media Owners and/or publishers employ ‘forward and store’  technology and give a lead time tolerance from bid request to display. Bids may be requested in advance (to allow pre-buffering or populate “playlists'' on devices, and the confirmation of playback may be delayed due to log collection or processing within publisher systems 

The current industry accepted lead time from ‘bid confirmation’ to ‘display’ can be up to 1 to 2 hours.

#### 7.9.2.4 Proprietary Device Attributes
Unlike the TV, Tablet and Mobile phone market, there are no dominant global brands supplying digital OOH screen technology to the market. Media Owners and/or Publishers source their own screen technology from a wide variety of manufacturers, technologies and installation partners resulting in each network having its own proprietary device types,identifiers, and other attributes such as user agent strings.

Some countries have attempted to create standards for describing the shape, size and format of the digital units, but to date there is no recognised global standard for identifying a digital out of home device or the users who it may reach.

In the case of user agents, oftentimes non-standard strings are used by Media Owners, which has been known to plague device detection and traffic protection systems. It is advised that Media Owners comply with the HTTP user agent standards set forth by the IETF and submit their user agents to the IAB Spiders and Bots List using the "Submit here" button on this page.

#### 7.9.2.5 Key Object Attributes To Use For DOOH Device Reference in OpenRTB
Key objects such as imp.qty and dooh have been added to the OpenRTB specification to enable the programmatic trading of the medium. The following table gives guidance to the use of more common OpenRTB object references when transacting DOOH bids.

| device.ifa_type        | string              | For DOOH this is usually given as "ppid" to show this is a publisher-provided device id or "sspid" to show this is an exchange-provided device id                                                                                         |
| device.eids             | object              | Used to send additional identifiers. e.g. geopath.org or oohspace.co.uk or to signal the ifa provider. See AdCom eids                                                                                                                     |
| imp.video.boxingallowed | integer             | For DOOH, when boxingallowed = 0, the video aspect ratio should strictly match that of the placement, as determined by the video w and h fields.                                                                                          |
| imp.dt                  | float               | Timestamp when the item is estimated to be fulfilled (e.g. when a DOOH impression will be displayed) in Unix format (i.e., milliseconds since the epoch).                                                                                 |
                                                                                                             
### 7.9.3 Commercially Critical Ad Quality
One bad advert being served at one time to one person is survivable. 
One bad advert served at one time to 1000’s of people in a public place will lead to a Media Owner and/or Publisher risking their contract/permission to serve ads to networks of screens. 

All ads being served on large commercial networks need to be manually pre-approved (typically involving human, visual review) by the publisher (and in some cases other 3rd parties e.g. venue landlords) before any bids can be accepted for display.

This means typical lead times for creative approval are on the order of “working days” - though they may be expedited through operational processes. It also means many publishers and networks will prohibit creative rotation, dynamic content, or changes post-approval - pending further review. 3rd-Party AdServing (3PAS) support (and support for HTML) is possible, but not guaranteed - including limitations of variations of typical banner ads like dynamic content, animation, or DCO.

For the above reasons, use of IAB Ad Management API (https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdManagementAPI/blob/master/Ad%20Management%20API%201.0%20FINAL.md) for creative submission to DOOH exchanges is strongly recommended, though many SSPs may have proprietary extensions to allow submitting ads to specific individual publishers.


### 7.9.4 DOOH Pricing
Bid price and clearing price should be expressed as a CPM rate per impression.  
For example, if an advertiser is bidding $2.50 CPM on a 1st price auction, and the auction is for 30.3 impressions:
multiplier = 30.3 (Impression multiplier from bid request)
bid.price = 2.50 (Bid price in CPM from bid response)

If the advertiser wins, tracking URL (e.g. burl) macros will contain the following values:
${AUCTION_PRICE} = 2.50 (The clearing price of the auction)
${AUCTION_MULTIPLIER} = 30.3 (The total quantity of impressions won; for confirmation only. This should always be less than or equal to the multiplier value sent in the bid request. This value is a float value greater than zero and may be less than one.)

To calculate the total cost of the transaction:
(AUCTION_PRICE / 1000) * AUCTION_MULTIPLIER = COST
(2.50 / 1000) * 30.3 = $0.07575

The above auction would translate to an invoice of $0.07575.

	
### 7.9.5 Auction Notifications
In DOOH, there can be significant delay between winning an auction, and the creative actually being rendered. For this reason, it is strongly recommended to separate the win and billing events, following OpenRTB best practises:
- nurl - Auction event notification URL fired when a bid has won the auction. Not a guarantee that impressions will occur.
- burl - Auction event billing URL fired when the creative has rendered on screen and impression[s] are billable.

## 7.10 - Updated Video Signals <a name="videosignals"></a>
#### 7.10.1 - Examples 
#### 7.10.1.1<strong> Instream Video:</strong>
Pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll ads that are played before, during or after the streaming video content that the consumer has requested. Instream video must be set to “sound on” by default at player start, or have explicitly clear user intent to watch the video content. While there may be other content surrounding the player, the video content must be the focus of the user’s visit. It should remain the primary content on the page and the only video player in-view capable of audio when playing. If the player converts to floating/sticky subsequent ad calls should accurately convey the updated player size.
	
![](assets/Instream.gif)
	
#### 7.10.1.2<strong> Accompanying Content:</strong>
Pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll ads that are played before, during, or after streaming video content. The video player loads and plays before, between, or after paragraphs of text or graphical content, and starts playing only when it enters the viewport. Accompanying content should only start playback upon entering the viewport. It may convert to a floating/sticky player as it scrolls off the page.

![](assets/Accompanying%20Content.gif)

#### 7.10.1.3<strong> Interstitial: </strong>
Video ads that are played without video content. During playback, it must be the primary focus of the page and take up the majority of the viewport and cannot be scrolled out of view. This can be in placements like in-app video or slideshows.

![](https://github.com/hillslatt/openrtb2.x/blob/develop/assets/interstitial.gif)

#### 7.10.1.4<strong> No Content/Standalone: </strong> 
Video ads that are played without streaming video content. This can be in placements like slideshows, native feeds, in-content or sticky/floating.

#### 7.10.2 - Using plcmt attribute in Object: Video

The release of updated definitions in AdCOM List: Plcmt Subtypes – Video and a new attribute (<code>plcmt</code> in [Object: Video](2.6.md#objectvideo)) to give publishers a way to signal video inventory in a way that more closely aligns with the updated ad format guidelines without breaking existing workstreams. 

<strong> Case 1: In-stream to Instream </strong>
	
If a publisher or player would like to send both the legacy value for In-Stream and the updated definition of Instream it should send the legacy value of placement=1 using the legacy <code>placement</code> attribute and the updated value of plcmt=1 using the <code>plcmt</code> attribute attributes in the video object. 

Here is an example ad request: 

	"video": {
	“placement”: “1”
	“plcmt”: “1” 
	}
	
The presence of the <code>placement</code> attribute refers to the legacy <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdCOM/blob/master/AdCOM%20v1.0%20FINAL.md#list--placement-subtypes---video-"> List: Placement Subtypes - Video in AdCOM </a>. It describes the inventory as In-stream per that definition. The presence of the <code>plcmt</code> attribute points to the updated <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdCOM/blob/master/AdCOM%20v1.0%20FINAL.md#list--plcmt-subtypes---video-">List: Plcmt Subtypes - Video</a> and defines the same inventory as “Instream” under the updated definition. 

<strong> Case 2: In-Article to No Content/Standalone </strong>
	
If a publisher or player would like to send both the legacy value for In-Article and the updated definition of No Content/Standalone it should send the legacy value of placement=3 using the legacy <code>placement</code> attribute and the updated value of plcmt=4 using the <code>plcmt</code> attribute attributes in the video object. 

Here is an example ad request: 

	"video": {
	“placement”: “3”
	“plcmt”: “4” 
	}

## 7.11 - Guidance on the Use of Floors <a name="floors"></a>

### 7.11.1 - History of Floors Fields

In versions of OpenRTB prior to 2.6-202307, floors were provided in the `Imp` and `Deal` objects with the fields `imp.bidfloor` and `deal.bidfloor`, respectively. The initial release of OpenRTB 2.6 (PDF version, pre-GitHub) introduced the `mincpmpersec` field in the `Audio` and `Video` objects, which was the first time that floor-related information was associated with specific formats.

As of OpenRTB 2.6-202307, `mincpmpersec` was also added to the `Deal` object, to allow sellers of audio or video supply to indicate to buyers the relationship between the duration of ads and their floor price in the ad server (in recognition of the fact that in audio/video ad serving, longer duration ads are typically priced higher than shorter ones). Concurrently, a new object serving a similar purpose, known as Duration Floors (see [Object: DurFloors](2.6.md#objectdurfloors)), was added to the `Audio` and `Video` objects, as well as the `Deal` object. The purpose of Duration Floors is to allow sellers to express a nonlinear relationship between the duration of creatives and the associated floor price of the impression opportunity.

### 7.11.2 - How Sellers Should Provide Floor Guidance

Sellers may specify floors in 3 locations within a BidRequest:
- `Imp` (via `imp.bidfloor`)
- `Video` or `Audio` (via `video.mincpmpersec` or `video.durfloors`, or `audio.mincpmpersec` or `audio.durfloors`)
- `Deal` (via `deal.bidfloor` or `deal.mincpmpersec` or `deal.durfloors`)

In the `Video` and `Audio` objects, sellers must only include one form of floor guidance. In other words, a seller should either provide `mincpmpersec` or `durfloors`. Similarly, in the `Deal` object, a seller should either provide `mincpmpersec` or `durfloors` or `bidfloor`.

### 7.11.2 - How Buyers Should Interpret Floor Guidance

Buyers bidding with a specific Deal ID should use the floor guidance provided in the corresponding `Deal` object. If there is no floor guidance in the `Deal` object or the buyer is bidding on an Open Market impression opportunity, the buyer should use the floor guidance provided in the corresponding `Video` or `Audio` object to inform their bids. Finally, if no floors are provided in the `Video` or `Audio` objects or the buyer is bidding on a Native or Banner impression opportunity, the buyer should use the floor guidance provided in the `Imp` object.
