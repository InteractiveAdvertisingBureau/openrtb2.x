## [Appendix A. Additional Information](#appendixa)

## [Appendix B. Specification Change Log](#appendixb)

## Getting Started <a name="started"></a>

This specification contains a detailed explanation of an RTB (Real-Time Bidding) interface. Not all objects are “required,” and each object may contain several optional parameters. As that term is used herein, “required” attributes are designated as such if their omission would technically break the protocol. This means that it is technically possible for two implementers to conduct a minimally viable transaction if all required attributes are included, and impossible without them. This does not, however, mean that including only required attributes will be satisfactory to implementers for business reasons. For example, a request with only required attributes does not supply any context about what is being bid on, such as whether it is for a site or app, or which site/app it is for. While the transaction is technically possible, in practice, market participants will likely find this to be unsatisfactory.

Some optional attributes are denoted "recommended." As that term is used herein “recommended” means that their inclusion is customary and, thus, likely to be expected by most implementers. While they are not required for a minimally viable transaction to occur, the market norm is to include such attributes; implementers may be unwilling to transact unless these attributes are included. The designation as "recommended" is based on awareness of these market norms and should not be interpreted as a suggestion by IAB Tech Lab that an implementer propagate any specific attribute. Implementers should determine which attributes they will make available based on discussion with their business partners, and in a manner consistent with applicable law.

*Example of how Required, Recommended and Optional attributes are presented.*

**IMPORTANT:** Since **recommended** attributes are not required, they may not be available from all supply sources. It is suggested that all parties to OpenRTB trasnaction develop an integration checklist to identify which attributes the supply side supports in the bid request, and which attributes the demand side requires for ad decisioning.
	
# 1. Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

## 1.1 - Mission / Overview <a name="mission"></a>

The mission of OpenRTB is to spur growth in Real-Time Bidding (RTB) marketplaces by providing open industry standards for communication between buyers of advertising and sellers of publisher inventory. There are several aspects to these standards including but not limited to the actual real-time bidding protocol, information taxonomies, offline configuration synchronization, and many more.

This document specifies a standard for the Real-Time Bidding Interface that grew out of previous OpenRTB collaboration on the “block list project” and the “OpenRTB Mobile” project. These protocol standards aim to simplify the connection between suppliers of publisher inventory (i.e., exchanges, networks working with publishers, and sell-side platforms) and competitive buyers of that inventory (i.e., bidders, demand side platforms, or networks working with advertisers).

The overall goal of OpenRTB is and has been to create a *lingua franca* for communicating between buyers and sellers. The intent is not to regulate exactly how each business operates. It aims to make integration between parties easier, so that innovation can happen at a deeper-level at each of the businesses in the ecosystem.

## 1.2 - History of OpenRTB <a name="history"></a>

OpenRTB was launched as a pilot project between three demand-side platforms (DataXu, MediaMath, and Turn) and three sell-side platforms (Admeld, PubMatic, and The Rubicon Project) in November 2010. The first goal was to standardize communication between parties for exchanging block lists. Version 1.0 of the OpenRTB block list specification was released in December 2010.

After a positive response from the industry, Nexage approached the OpenRTB project with a proposal to create an API specification for OpenRTB focusing on the actual real-time bid request/response protocol and specifically to support mobile advertising. The mobile subcommittee was formed between companies representing the buy-side (DataXu, Fiksu, and [X+1]) and companies representing the sell- side (Nexage, Pubmatic, Smaato, and Jumptap). This project resulted in the OpenRTB Mobile 1.0 specification, which was released in February 2011.

Following the release of the mobile specification, a video subcommittee was formed with video ad exchanges (BrightRoll and Adap.tv) collaborating with DataXu and ContextWeb to incorporate support for video. The goal was to incorporate support for display, video, and mobile in one document. This effort resulted in OpenRTB 2.0, which was released as a unified standard in June 2011.

Due to very widespread adoption by the industry, OpenRTB was adopted as an IAB Tech Lab standard in January 2012 with the release of version 2.1.

## 2. OpenRTB Basics <a name="rtbbasics"></a>

The following figure illustrates the OpenRTB interactions between an exchange and its bidders. Ad requests originate at publisher sites or applications. For each inbound ad request, bid requests are broadcast to bidders, responses are evaluated under prevailing auction rules, and a winner is selected. The winning bidder is notified of the auction win via a win notice. Ad markup can either be included in the bid prospectively or in response to the win notice. A separate billing notice is also available to accommodate varying policies enacted by exchanges which are beyond the scope of the OpenRTB specification (e.g., billing on device delivery, viewability, etc.). The win notice informs the bidder’s pricing algorithms of a success, whereas the billing notice indicates that spend should actually be applied. A loss notification is also available to inform the bidder of the reason their bid did not win.

The URLs for win, billing, and loss notices and the ad markup itself can contain any of several standard macros that enable the exchange to communicate critical data to the bidder (e.g., clearing price).

*Figure 2: Reference Model - Request Sequence.*

This specification focuses on the real-time interactions of bid request and response and the win, billing, and loss notices. Related specifications include:

- [AdCOM](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdCOM/blob/master/AdCOM%20v1.0%20FINAL.md): The Advertising Common Object Model, a companion specification that defines common objects and values expected to be used across many IAB Tech Lab specifications. As of OpenRTB 2.6, all enumerated lists used by OpenRTB 2.6 are kept in AdCOM to enable more rapid iteration.
- [OpenRTB Ad Management API](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdManagementAPI/blob/master/Ad%20Management%20API%201.0%20FINAL.md): A companion specification for facilitating creative review between bidders and exchanges.

Other interactions (e.g., block list synchronization, traffic control, etc.) are candidates for future OpenRTB initiatives or alternate projects.

## 2.1 - Transport <a name="transport"></a>

The base protocol between an exchange and its bidders is HTTP. Specifically, HTTP POST is required for bid requests to accommodate greater payloads than HTTP GET and facilitate the use of binary representations. Win notices may be either POST or GET at the discretion of the exchange.

Calls returning content (e.g., any bid response, a win notice that returns markup) should return HTTP code 200. Calls returning no content in response to valid requests (e.g., an empty bid response which is one option for indicating no-bid, a win notice that does not return markup) should return HTTP 204.
Invalid calls (e.g., a bid request containing a malformed or corrupt payload) should return HTTP 400 with no content.

**BEST PRACTICE**: One of the simplest and most effective ways of improving connection performance is to enable HTTP Persistent Connections, also known as Keep-Alive. This has a profound impact on overall performance by reducing connection management overhead as well as CPU utilization on both sides of the interface.

## 2.2 - Security <a name="security"></a>

HTTPS is not technically required for a functioning OpenRTB implementation. However, HTTPS is increasingly customary. It is strongly recommended that exchanges and bidders use only HTTPS.

## 2.3 - Data Format <a name="dataformat"></a>

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the suggested format for bid request and bid response data payloads. JSON was chosen for its combination of human readability and compactness. The data payloads are described in Section 3 and Section 4.

Optionally, an exchange may also offer binary representations (e.g., compressed JSON, ProtoBuf, Avro, etc.), which can be more efficient in terms of transmission time and bandwidth. The IAB Tech Lab may offer reference implementations for these or other formats. When available, the use of these reference implementations is highly recommended to reduce exchange-specific variations.

The bid request specifies the representation as a mime type using the Content-Type HTTP header. The mime type for the standard JSON representation is “application/json” as shown. The format of the bid response must be the same as the bid request.

```Content-Type: application/json```

If alternative binary representations are used, the exchange or SSP should specify the Content-Type appropriately. For example: “Content-Type: avro/binary” or “Content-Type: application/x-protobuf”. If the content-type is missing, the bidder should assume the type is application/json, unless a different default has been selected by an exchange.

As a convention, the absence of an attribute has a formal meaning. In most cases, this indicates that the value is unknown, unless otherwise specified.

## 2.4 - Data Encoding <a name="dataencoding"></a>

Compressing data sent between exchanges and bidders can be very beneficial. Compression greatly reduces the size of data transferred and thus saves network bandwidth for both exchanges and bidders. To realize these savings fully, compression should be enabled for both the bid request sent by the exchange and the bid response returned by the bidder.

Compression can be enabled on the bid response using standard HTTP 1.1 mechanisms. Most webservers already support gzip compression of response content and as such it is an ideal choice. For an exchange to signal they would like the response to be compressed, it should set the standard HTTP 1.1 Accept-Encoding header. The encoding value used should be “gzip”.

```accept-encoding: gzip```

This header represents to bidders an indication by the exchange that it is capable of accepting gzip encoding for the response. If the bidder server supports this and is correctly configured, it will automatically respond with content that is gzip encoded. This will be indicated using the standard HTTP 1.1 Content-Encoding header.

```content-encoding: gzip```

To enable compression on the bid request, it must first be agreed upon between the exchange and the bidder that this is supported. This is similar to when a custom data format is used since the exchange has to know both format and encoding before sending the bid request. If the bidder supports it, the exchange should indicate it is sending a gzip compressed bid request by setting the HTTP 1.1 Content- Encoding header. The encoding value used should be "gzip".

```content-enconding: gzip```

If this header is not set then it is assumed that the request content isn’t encoded. In HTTP 1.1, the Content-Encoding header is usually only used for response content. However, by using this header for the request content as well we are able to indicate a request is compressed regardless of the data format used. This is useful since even binary data formats can benefit from being compressed.

## 2.5 - OpenRTB Version HTTP Header <a name="httpheader"></a>

The OpenRTB Version should be passed in the header of a bid request with a custom header parameter. This will allow bidders to recognize the version of the message contained before attempting to parse the request.

Additionally, it is recommended albeit optional that bidders place an identically formatted message in the HTTP header of the response with the protocol version the bidder has implemented. The message may contain a different version number than the request header.

*x-openrtb-version: 2.6*

This version should be specified as `<major>.<minor>` (e.g., 2.6).

## 2.6 - Versioning Behavior <a name="versioningbehavior"></a>

As of OpenRTB 2.6-202211, OpenRTB's version number is only incremented on breaking changes. In other words, OpenRTB 2.7 should be considered a distinct version from OpenRTB 2.6 when there is a need for distinguishing versions. For example, a demand source might regard the version header when parsing a bid request received from a supply source. See OpenRTB Principles.

The current version of the OpenRTB specification is updated approximately once a month if there are non-breaking improvements to be released such as new fields, objects, or values in enumerated lists. Errata, such as clarifications or corrections to descriptions not materially impacting the specification itself, are also addressed during monthly updates. See Errata.

Release branches are created for each monthly release and the history of these can be reviewed on GitHub. The master branch for the repository will always reflect the most recent release, whereas ongoing development work occurs in the 'develop' branch.

This versioning policy is a break from historical practice for OpenRTB 2.x. In versions of OpenRTB prior to 2.6, major version numbers represent breaking changes and minor version numbers represent non-breaking changes.
This means:

- Bidders and exchanges must tolerate receiving new or unexpected fields and enumerated list values gracefully, treating them as unknown or ignoring them
- Bidders and exchanges should freely transmit new fields or enumerated list values

For example, if a new field or object is introduced in a future version of OpenRTB 2.6, exchanges should immediately start transmitting it to bidders, if the exchange chooses to implement support for that field. Bidders should start consuming it at their discretion, if it is relevant to them. Neither party needs to explicitly negotiate an "upgrade" to the latest release, but rather should discuss specific fields of interest as they become available.

New minor versions of OpenRTB 2.6 may introduce additional optional ways of handling things. For example, burl field was introduced in OpenRTB 2.5. Use of `burl` (instead of including a pixel in markup in `adm` field) is a breaking change for a specific exchange <> bidder integration, but this is a result of a decision between these parties to switch impression counting methodology and not a result of OpenRTB 2.5 itself. Partners should discuss such situations before making breaking changes to their integrations.
  
## 2.7 - Privacy <a name="privacy"></a>

Without limiting the scope of the Disclaimer, the OpenRTB specification does include several features to support implementer’s communication of information regarding consumer privacy, including, but not limited to:

- The status of do not track headers (Section 3.2.18)
- Presence of site/app privacy policies (Section 3.2.13 and Section 3.2.14)
- Regulations or laws that the transmitter of a bid request believes are applicable (Section 3.2.3)
- Consent and opt-out information strings for the user (Global Privacy Platform, US Privacy String and Transparency and Consent Framework consent strings) (Section 3.2.3 and Section 3.2.20)

As noted in the Disclaimer, each implementer is responsible to ensure that their implementation complies with any applicable laws, regulations, or self-regulatory frameworks.

## 2.8 - Relationship to Brand Safety Certified <a name="relationshiptocertified"></a>

OpenRTB is fully compatible with the Brand Safety Certified available here: [https://www.tagtoday.net/brand-safety](https://www.tagtoday.net/brand-safety) .

## 2.9 - Customization and Extensions <a name="customization"></a>

The OpenRTB spec allows for exchange specific customization and extensions of the specification. Any object may contain extensions. To keep extension fields consistent across platforms, they should consistently be named `ext`.

In order to better support common and well known extensions, IAB Tech Lab is now hosting these extensions at our Github repository : https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb/tree/master/extensions

# 3. Bid Request Specification <a name="bidspecification"></a>

RTB transactions are initiated when an exchange or other supply source sends a bid request to a bidder. The bid request consists of the top-level bid request object, at least one impression object, and may optionally include additional objects providing impression context.

## 3.1 - Object Model <a name="objectmodel"></a>

Following is the object model for the bid request. The top-level object (i.e., in JSON the unnamed outer object) is denoted as `BidRequest` in the model. Of its direct subordinates, only `Imp` is technically required since it is fundamental to describing the impression being sold and it requires at least one of `Banner` (which may allow multiple formats), `Video`, `Audio`, and `Native` to define the type of impression (i.e., whichever one or more the publisher is willing to accept; although a bid will be for exactly one of those specified). An impression can optionally be subject to a private marketplace.

*Figure 3: Bid Request object model.*

Other subordinates to the `BidRequest` provide various forms of information to assist bidders in making targeting and pricing decisions.

Not shown in the model figure is an extensions object. This is an object of undefined structure that can be added to any other object to convey exchange-specific extensions to the standard. Exchanges using these objects are responsible for publishing their extensions to their bidders.

The following table summarizes the objects in the Bid Request model and serves as an index into the detailed definitions in the subsections that follow.

# 3.2 - Object Specifications <a name="objectspecs"></a>

### 3.2.1 - Object: BidRequest <a name="objectbidrequest"></a>

The top-level bid request object contains a globally unique bid request or auction ID. This `id` attribute is required as is at least one impression object (Section 3.2.4). Other attributes in this top-level object establish rules and restrictions that apply to all impressions being offered.

There are also several subordinate objects that provide detailed data to potential buyers. Among these are the `Site`, `App` and `DOOH`objects, which describe the type of published media in which the impression(s) appear. These objects are highly recommended, but only one applies to a given bid request depending on whether the media is browser-based web content, a non-browser application, or Digital Out of Home inventory respectively.

### 3.2.2 - Object: Source <a name="objectsource"></a>

This object describes the nature and behavior of the entity that is the source of the bid request upstream from the exchange. The primary purpose of this object is to define post-auction or upstream decisioning when the exchange itself does not control the final decision. A common example of this is header bidding, but it can also apply to upstream server entities such as another RTB exchange, a mediation platform, or an ad server combines direct campaigns with 3rd party demand in decisioning.

### 3.2.4 - Object: Imp <a name="objectimp"></a>

This object describes an ad placement or impression being auctioned. A single bid request can include multiple `Imp` objects, a use case for which might be an exchange that supports selling all ad positions on a given page. Each `Imp` object has a required ID so that bids can reference them individually.

The presence of `Banner` (Section 3.2.6), `Video` (Section 3.2.7), and/or `Native` (Section 3.2.9) objects subordinate to the `Imp` object indicates the type of impression being offered. The publisher can choose one such type which is the typical case or mix them at their discretion. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered type.

### 3.2.5 - Object: Metric <a name="objectmetric"></a>

This object is associated with an impression as an array of metrics. These metrics can offer insight into the impression to assist with decisioning such as average recent viewability, click-through rate, etc. Each metric is identified by its type, reports the value of the metric, and optionally identifies the source or vendor measuring the value.

### 3.2.6 - Object: Banner <a name="objectbanner"></a>

This object represents the most general type of impression.

An array of `Banner` objects can also appear within the `Video` to describe optional companion ads defined in the VAST specification.

The presence of a `Banner` as a subordinate of the `Imp` object indicates that this impression is offered as a banner type impression. At the publisher’s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as video, audio, and/or native by also including as `Imp` subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

### 3.2.7 - Object: Video <a name="objectvideo"></a>

This object represents a video impression. Many of the fields are non-essential for minimally viable transactions, but are included to offer fine control when needed. Video in OpenRTB generally assumes compliance with the VAST standard. As such, the notion of companion ads is supported by optionally including an array of `Banner` objects (refer to the `Banner` object in Section 3.2.6) that define these companion ads.

The presence of a `Video` as a subordinate of the `Imp` object indicates that this impression is offered as a video type impression. At the publisher’s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as `Banner`, `Audio`, and/or `Native` by also including as `Imp` subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

### 3.2.9 - Object: Native <a name="objectnative"></a>

This object represents a native type impression. Native ad units are intended to blend seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter or Facebook post). As such, the response must be well-structured to afford the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.

The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB called the <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/openrtb-native/">Dynamic Native Ads API</a>. It defines the request parameters and response markup structure of native ad units. This object provides the means of transporting request parameters as an opaque string so that the specific parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Dynamic Native Ads API. Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that specification.

The presence of a `Native` as a subordinate of the `Imp` object indicates that this impression is offered as a native type impression. At the publisher’s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as `Banner`, `Video`, and/or `Audio` by also including as `Imp` subordinates objects of those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.

### 3.2.19 - Object: Geo <a name="objectgeo"></a>

This object encapsulates various methods for specifying a geographic location. When subordinate to a `Device` object, it indicates the location of the device which can also be interpreted as the user’s current location. When subordinate to a `User` object, it indicates the location of the user’s home base (i.e., not necessarily their current location).

The `lat`/`lon` attributes should only be passed if they conform to the accuracy depicted in the `type` attribute. For example, the centroid of a geographic region such as postal code should not be passed.

### 3.2.20 - Object: User <a name="objectuser"></a>

This object contains information known or derived about the human user of the device (i.e., the audience for advertising). The user `id` is an exchange artifact and may be subject to rotation or other privacy policies. However, when present, this user ID should be stable long enough to serve reasonably as the basis for frequency capping and retargeting.

### 3.2.21 - Object: Data <a name="objectdata"></a>

The data and segment objects together allow additional data about the related object (e.g., user, content) to be specified. This data may be from multiple sources whether from the exchange itself or third parties as specified by the `id` field. A bid request can mix data objects from multiple providers. The specific data providers in use should be published by the exchange a priori to its bidders.

### 3.2.29 - Object: UserAgent <a name="objectuseragent"></a>

Structured user agent information, which can be used when a client supports [User-Agent Client Hints](https://wicg.github.io/ua-client-hints/). If both `device.ua` and `device.sua` are present in the bid request, `device.sua` should be considered the more accurate representation of the device attributes. This is because the `device.ua` may contain a frozen or reduced user agent string due to deprecation of user agent strings by browsers.

### 3.2.31 - Object: Qty <a name="objectqty"></a>

A programmatic impression is often referred to as a ‘spot’ in digital out-of-home and CTV, with an impression being a unique member of the audience viewing it. Therefore, a standard means of passing a multiplier in the bid request, representing the total quantity of impressions, is required. This object includes the impression multiplier, and describes the source of the multiplier value.

# 4. Bid Response Specification <a name="bidresponsespec"></a>

RTB responses contain bids that reference specific impressions within a bid request. Bids are in essence an offer to buy. The bid response consists of the top-level bid response object and optional objects that depict the specific bids. An empty HTTP response constitutes a no-bid and is in fact the most bandwidth friendly form of this signal although returning a response with a “no-bid reason” is encouraged. A malformed response or a response that contains no actual bids will also be interpreted as no-bid.

## 4.1 - Object Model <a name="4.2objectmodel"></a>

Following is the object model for the bid response. The top-level object (i.e., in JSON the unnamed outer object) is denoted as `BidResponse` in the model. A bid response may contain bids from multiple “seats” (i.e., the buying entity upstream from the actual bidder). In fact, a response may contain multiple bids from the same seat; typically but not necessarily from different campaigns. This can improve the seat’s chances of winning since most exchanges enforce various block lists on behalf of their publishers. 

![](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/openrtb2.x/blob/864a56706b106eda94c03abefaa01dd43544864c/assets/Figure3.png)

*Figure 4: Bid Response object model.*

Referring to the figure, the actual response objects are shown on the left, specifically the `BidResponse` top level object the seat specific `SeatBid` collections of `Bid` objects. The other objects shown are those objects from the bid request to which response objects related. Specifically, `BidResponse` includes the `BidRequest` ID for positive tracking purposes, and since a request can include multiple impressions `Bid` includes the ID of the `Imp` for which the bid is an offer to purchase. If a bid is made under the terms of a private marketplace deal, the `Bid` also includes the ID of the specific `Deal` object.

Not shown in the model figure is an extensions object. This is an object of undefined structure that can be added to any other object to convey bidder-specific extensions to the standard. Bidders using these objects are responsible for publishing their extensions to their exchanges.

The following table summarizes the objects in the Bid Response model and serves as an index into the detailed definitions in the subsections that follow.

  <tr>
    <td><strong>Object&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td>

</table>


## 4.2 - Object Specifications <a name="objectspecs"></a>

The subsections that follow define each of the objects in the bid response model. Several conventions are used throughout:
- Attributes are “required” if their omission would technically break the protocol.
- Some optional attributes are denoted “recommended” due to their elevated business importance.
- Unless a default value is explicitly specified, an omitted attribute is interpreted as “unknown”.

### 4.2.1 - Object: BidResponse <a name="objectbidresponse"></a>

This object is the top-level bid response object (i.e., the unnamed outer JSON object). The `id` attribute reflects the bid request ID for logging purposes. Similarly, `bidid` is an optional response tracking ID for bidders. If specified, it can be included in the subsequent win notice call if the bidder wins. At least one `seatbid` object is required, which contains at least one bid for an impression. Other attributes are optional.

To express a “no-bid”, the options are to return an empty response with HTTP 204. Alternately if the bidder wishes to convey to the exchange a reason for not bidding, just a `BidResponse` object is returned with a reason code in the `nbr` attribute.

### 4.2.2 - Object: SeatBid <a name="objectseatbid"></a>

A bid response can contain multiple `SeatBid` objects, each on behalf of a different bidder seat and each containing one or more individual bids. If multiple impressions are presented in the request, the `group` attribute can be used to specify if a seat is willing to accept any impressions that it can win (default) or if it is only interested in winning any if it can win them all as a group.

### 4.2.3 - Object: Bid <a name="objectbid"></a>

A `SeatBid` object contains one or more `Bid` objects, each of which relates to a specific impression in the bid request via the `impid` attribute and constitutes an offer to buy that impression for a given `price`.

For each bid, the `nurl` attribute can contain the win notice URL. If the bidder wins the impression, the exchange calls this notice URL to inform the bidder of the win and to convey certain information using substitution macros (see Section 4.5) such as the clearing price. The win notice return or the `adm` attribute can be used to serve markup (see Section 4.4). In either case, the exchange will also apply the aforementioned substitution to any macros found in the markup.

**BEST PRACTICE**: The essential function of the win notice is to inform a bidder that they won an auction. It does not necessarily imply ad delivery, creative viewability, or billability. Exchanges are highly encouraged to publish to their bidders their event triggers, billing policies, and any other meaning they attach to the win notice. Also, please refer to Section 7.2 for additional guidance on expirations.

**BEST PRACTICE**: Firing of the billing notice should be server-side and as “close” as possible to where the exchange books revenue in order to minimize discrepancies between exchange and bidder.

**BEST PRACTICE**: For VAST Video, the IAB Tech Lab prescribes that the VAST impression event is the official signal that the impression is billable. If the `burl` attribute is specified, it too should be fired at the same time if the exchange is adhering to this policy. However, subtle technical issues may lead to additional discrepancies and bidders are cautioned to avoid this scenario.

Several other attributes are used for ad quality checks or enforcing publisher restrictions. These include the advertiser domain via `adomain`, a non-cache-busted URL to an image representative of the content of the campaign via `iurl`, an ID of the campaign and of the creative within the campaign via `cid` and `crid` respectively, an array of creative attribute via `attr`, and the dimensions via `h` and `w`. If the bid pertains to a private marketplace deal, the `dealid` attribute is used to reference that agreement from the bid request.

## 4.3 - Ad Serving Options <a name="adservingoptions"></a>

The fulfilment of an RTB transaction within the scope of this OpenRTB specification lies in the delivery of markup. Depending on the impression and other ad type constraints, this markup can be XHTML, HTML5, XHTML or HTML5 with embedded JavaScript, a VAST document for video or audio, a Native ad unit structure, and potentially other formats in the future.

The OpenRTB specification does not require any processing of the ad markup by the exchange other than macro substitution (refer to Section 4.5) and delivery to the supply-side. There are, however, multiple standard methods for transferring markup from the bidder to the exchange. The method used is at the discretion of the bidder, subject to support by the exchange. Bidders and exchanges should discuss the method to be used during integration.

### 4.3.1 - Markup Served on the Win Notice <a name="markupservedonwin"></a>

In this method, ad markup is returned to the exchange is via the win notice. In this case, the response body of the win notice call (i.e., invoking the `bid.nurl` attribute) contains the ad markup and only the ad markup; there must be no other structured data in the response body. Using this method, the `bid.adm` attribute must be omitted.

### 4.3.2 - Markup Served in the Bid <a name="markupservedinbid"></a>

In this method, ad markup is returned directly in the bid itself. This is accomplished via the `bid.adm`
attribute. If both the `adm` attribute and win notice return data, the `adm` contents will take precedence.

### 4.3.3 - Comparison of Ad Serving Approaches <a name="comparisonofapproaches"></a>

Each of the ad serving methods has its own advantages that may be of varying importance to either the exchange or the bidder.

**Ad Served on the Win Notice**

- *Reduced Bandwidth Costs*: Serving ad markup only upon winning can save large amounts of bandwidth usage, the costs for which can be large at high volumes or when sending multiple bids per bid response.
- *Additional Bidder Flexibility*: Bidders may typically know the ad they will serve at the time of bid, but this provides an additional optional decision point after the clearing price has been established.

**Ad Served in the Bid**

- *Reduced Risk of Forfeiture*: A forfeit is the scenario in which a bidder wins, but forfeits due to failure to serve the ad markup. The risk of an additional HTTP failure (e.g., calling the win notice) is mitigated by this method.
- *Potential Concurrency*: The exchange can choose to return that ad markup and call the win notice concurrently, thereby improving user experience.


## 4.4 - Substitution Macros <a name="substitutionmacros"></a>

The win notice and billing notice URLs and their format are defined by the bidder. For the exchange to convey certain information to the bidder (e.g., the clearing price), several substitution macros can be inserted into these URLs. Prior to calling a win or billing notice URL, the exchange will search the specified URL for any of the defined macros and replace them with the appropriate data.<br>
Note that the substitution is simple in the sense that wherever a legal macro is found, it will be replaced without regard for syntax correctness. Furthermore, if the source value is an optional parameter that was not specified, the macro will simply be removed (i.e., replaced with a zero-length string).

These same substitution macros can also be placed in the ad markup. The exchange will perform the same data substitutions as in the aforementioned notice URLs. This occurs irrespective of whether the markup is returned on the win notice or passed in the `bid.adm` attribute of the bid response. A use case for macros in the ad markup might be when a bidder prefers to receive its win notification from the device itself. To accomplish this, the bidder would include a tracking pixel in the ad markup, the URL for which would include any of the available macros.

     </td>
     </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Note that OpenRTB compliance exchanges must support all macros for which data is available and support substitution in both markup and URLs for win and billing notification.

**BEST PRACTICE**: When rendering markup for test or ad quality purposes, some macro values (e.g., clearing price) may not be known. In these cases, substitute “AUDIT” as the macro value.

**BEST PRACTICE**: Encoding of macro data should be used sparingly due to the additional processing overhead. For communications strictly between exchange and bidder (e.g., a win notice called from the exchange), encoding is generally considered unnecessary.


Prior to substitution, macro data values can be encoded for security purposes using various obfuscation or encryption algorithms. This may be of particular interest for use cases where price information is carried beyond the exchange, through the publisher, and into the device browser via a tracking pixel in the markup.

To specify that a particular macro is to be encoded, the suffix “`:X`” should be appended to the macro name, where X is a string that indicates the algorithm to be used. Algorithms choices are not defined by this specification and must be mutually agreed upon between parties. As an example, suppose that the price macro is to be encoded using Base64 and that its code is “`B64`”. The macro would then be written as follows:

`${AUCTION PRICE:B64}`

### 4.4.1 - Notes on the macro ${AUCTION_MIN_TO_WIN} <a name="notesonmacro"></a>

Except where the value "AUDIT" applies, as above, the macro is replaced by:

- The empty string, if the exchange chooses not to provide the value, for example because:
  - The bid was not allowed into the auction, e.g., because of blocks on the seat, advertiser, etc.
  - Per the loss code, price was not the deciding factor in the loss.
  - As dictated by exchange privacy controls, e.g., if price data is not shared to bidders that did not meet the desired floor, or if the exchange supports a publisher or winning bidder election not to share price data with the other bidders.
 
- The minimum price required to tie with the winning bid, when your bid lost to another in the auction.
- The minimum price required to tie with the next-closest bid, or the floor if there was only one bid, when your bid won the auction.

Note, the exchange in question may not be the final decision-maker. It may propagate two or more bids into a second auction. In that case, still only one auction bid is the "winner" and the macro is replaced for all bids as above.

In the following examples, assume an auction with a floor price of $0.85, and that each row is a competing bid. Note the exchange may also choose to replace the macros with the empty string for the reasons above.

For a first-price auction:<br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Bid Price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td>
    <td><strong>${AUCTION_PRICE}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td>
    <td><strong>${AUCTION_MIN_TO_WIN}</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>$1.00</code></td>
    <td>$1.00</td>
    <td>$0.90</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>$0.90</code></td>
    <td>Empty string</td>

    <td>Empty string</td>
    <td>$1.00</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Invalid</code></td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>Empty string</td>
     </td>
     </td>
  </tr>
</table>


For a second-price auction (where, for the sake of the illustration, the clearing price is the second-best price plus $0.01):<br>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Bid Price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td>

# 5. Enumerated Lists Specification <a name="enumeratedlistsspec"></a>

OpenRTB utilizes the Advertising Common Object Model ([AdCOM](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdCOM/) 1.0) for enumerations. In previous versions, any additional enumerations required not just a documentation update, but a version update. Using AdCOM 1.0, items will be able to be added to enumerations without requiring a new OpenRTB version. Implementers will need to ensure that they are utilizing the most current enumerations as possible as new standards come out.

# 6. Bid Request/Response Samples <a name="bidrequestresponsesamples"></a>

## 6.1 - GitHub Repository <a name="githubrepo"></a>

The official OpenRTB Github repository now contains a set of validated example requests. This repository should be considered the canonical examples for implementers.

### 6.2.4 Example 4 – Video <a name="example4video"></a>

The following example illustrates a bid request for a video impression with two companion ad slots (1 expandable). Additionally, the video content itself is described in the "content" object. A few notes about specific fields in the example:

- `battr`: User interactive and alert type ads (value “13” and “14”, respectively) are explicitly being blocked for both the video and its companions.
- `pos`: Indicates this opportunity is “above the fold”.
- `companiontype`: Indicates only static or HTML resources are allowed.

### 6.3.4 - Example 4 – Native Markup Returned Inline <a name="nativemarkupreturnedinline"></a>
	
Following is an example of a bid response that returns a native ad inline to be served. The `adm` attribute contains an encoded string of a native ad request that conforms to the Dynamic Native Ads API and specifically the same version as that used for the request string. Alternatively, the `adm` attribute could have been omitted in favor of returning the native ad markup in the response to the win notice `nurl`.

```javascript
{

  "id": "123",
  
    "seatbid": [
    
      {
      
        "bid": [
	
          {
	  
            "id": "12345", "impid": "2", "price": 3.00, "nurl": "http://example.com/winnoticeurl",
	    
            "adm": "{\"native\":{\"ver\":\"1.0\",\"link\":{ ... },
	    
            \"imptrackers\":[ ... ],\"assets\":[ ... ]}}"
	    
}

        ]
	
      }
      
    ]
    
}
```
